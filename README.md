Simple Webpack Project

This project is a basic setup using Webpack, designed to bundle JavaScript, CSS, Sass/SCSS & LESS, Images, Fonts, and TypeScript. The project serves as an example of how to configure Webpack for a simple web application, including features like Hot Module Replacement (HMR), CSS and LESS preprocessing, TypeScript transpilation, and ES6+ JavaScript transpilation.

Features
Webpack: Module bundler and build tool for modern JavaScript applications.
Hot Module Replacement (HMR): Automatically updates modules in the browser without requiring a full page reload.
Sass/SCSS & LESS: Preprocessing for CSS with support for variables, nesting, and more.
TypeScript: Support for static typing and modern JavaScript features.
ESLint: JavaScript and TypeScript linting to enforce code quality and consistency.
Babel: Transpilation for ES6+ JavaScript to ensure compatibility with older browsers.
Asset Management: Handles images, fonts, and other assets using Webpack loaders.
Source Maps: Debugging support with source maps to trace errors and warnings to the original code.

GETTING STARTED

Prerequisites:
Make sure you have the following installed:

Node.js (version 14.x or later)
npm (Node package manager)

Installation
Clone the repository:

Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/simple-webpack-project.git

cd simple-webpack-project

Install dependencies:
npm install
npm install eslint --save-dev
npm install --save-dev typescript ts-loader
npm install --save-dev less less-loader sass sass-loader
npm install --save-dev webpack-bundle-analyzer eslint-webpack-plugin

These commands install:

ESLint: Linter for JavaScript and TypeScript.
TypeScript: Static type-checking and transpilation.
ts-loader: A TypeScript loader for Webpack.
LESS and SASS: CSS preprocessors.
less-loader and sass-loader: Loaders to process LESS and SASS files with Webpack.
webpack-bundle-analyzer: Visualizes the size of webpack output files.
eslint-webpack-plugin: Integrates ESLint into the Webpack build process.

Running the Project
To start the development server with live reloading and HMR:

npm start
This will open the application in your default browser at http://localhost:9000/.

Building for Production
To create a production build:

npm run build
The output will be in the dist/ directory, ready to be deployed.

Linting
To run ESLint and check for code style issues:

npm run lint

CONFIGURATION:
Webpack
Webpack is configured to handle:

JavaScript/TypeScript: Bundling and transpiling (with Babel and TypeScript).
CSS/Sass/LESS: Processing with Sass and LESS, and extracting into separate CSS files.
Assets: Handling images, fonts, and other assets.
Plugins: CleanWebpackPlugin for cleaning the dist folder before each build, HtmlWebpackPlugin for generating the index.html, and more.
ESLint
ESLint is configured to lint both JavaScript and TypeScript files, ensuring code quality and consistency throughout the project.

Babel
Babel is configured to transpile modern JavaScript (ES6+) into a format compatible with older browsers.

TypeScript
TypeScript configuration is handled via tsconfig.json, providing static typing and modern JavaScript features in your development.

Known Issues
Hot Module Replacement: Ensure that liveReload: true is set in webpack.config.mjs to enable proper live reloading and HMR.
MIME Type Errors: Check the configuration of asset handling in Webpack if you encounter MIME type errors.
Build Artifacts: The CleanWebpackPlugin may remove files in the dist/ folder after running the development server. Ensure proper configuration or remove the plugin if needed.
